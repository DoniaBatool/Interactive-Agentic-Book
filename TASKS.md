Generate clear, atomic, ordered tasks for implementing Feature 0 — Base Project Initialization for the AI-Agentic Interactive Book Platform.

Convert the implementation plan into step-by-step actionable tasks, where each task is small, unambiguous, and directly executable by /sp.implement.

Tasks must include:

- Setting up Docusaurus project with initial documentation structure
- Creating global layout components (navbar, footer) as placeholders
- Creating folder structure for BetterAuth, without adding logic
- Creating folder structure for OpenAI AgentKit integration (no logic)
- Creating folder structure for Claude subagents and reusable skills (empty placeholders)
- Initializing backend FastAPI scaffold
- Creating Qdrant client wrapper placeholder
- Creating LLM provider wrapper placeholders for OpenAI and Claude
- Creating initial routing files for backend (empty)
- Setting up env.example with required variables
- Creating folders:
  /frontend
  /backend
  /agents
  /skills
  /chapters
  /content
  /public
  /scripts

No business logic should be included — only file creation, folder creation, and scaffolding setup.

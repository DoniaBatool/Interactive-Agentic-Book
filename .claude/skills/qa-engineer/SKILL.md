# Skill: QA Engineer (Test Strategy + Confidence)

## Description
Expert-level QA skill to build confidence in changes: test strategy, test pyramid, automation, regression prevention, and release readiness.

## When to Use
- Before deploying risky features
- After recurring regressions
- When requirements are unclear and need testable acceptance criteria

## Playbook
1. **Define acceptance tests**
   - Convert requirements into verifiable checks
2. **Build test pyramid**
   - unit → integration → e2e (minimum necessary)
3. **Add regression tests**
   - Every bug gets a test
4. **Release readiness**
   - Smoke suite + monitoring checks

## Output Artifacts
- Test plan (what/why)
- Automated suites (unit/integration/e2e)
- Regression checklist

## Integration
- Works with: `change-management`, `edge-case-tester`, `production-checklist`

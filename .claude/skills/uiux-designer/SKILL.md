# Skill: UI/UX Designer (Modern, Accessible, Conversion-Friendly UI)

## Description
Expert-level UI/UX skill for designing and refining user experiences: information architecture, interaction design, accessibility, and consistent visual systems.

## When to Use
- Navbar/layout issues (RTL, responsiveness, “jumping” UI)
- Any new page or multi-step flow (auth, onboarding, forms)
- Redesigning hero sections / landing pages

## Playbook
1. **Define user goals**
   - primary tasks + success metrics
2. **Design system**
   - typography, spacing, color tokens, components
3. **Accessibility**
   - focus states, contrast, keyboard navigation
4. **States**
   - loading, empty, error, success (no layout shift)
5. **Validate**
   - test on mobile + slow network + RTL

## Output Artifacts
- Wireframes + component specs
- CSS token strategy (light/dark/RTL)
- UX acceptance criteria checklist

## Integration
- Works with: `frontend-developer`, `edge-case-tester`, `change-management`

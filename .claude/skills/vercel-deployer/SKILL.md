# Skill: Vercel Deployer (Builds, Previews, and Edge Performance)

## Description
Expert-level skill for deploying frontend apps to Vercel: environment variables, preview deployments, caching, headers/redirects, and performance best practices.

## When to Use
- Deploying Docusaurus/Next.js/React to Vercel
- Preview deployments needed for PRs
- Fixing caching/theme/asset issues in production

## Playbook
1. **Configure project**
   - build command, output dir, framework presets
2. **Env vars**
   - split dev/staging/prod; never commit secrets
3. **Previews**
   - verify critical pages + auth flows
4. **Performance**
   - cache headers, image optimization, bundle checks

## Output Artifacts
- Vercel config notes (build, output, env)
- Redirects/headers strategy
- Deployment runbook

## Integration
- Works with: `deployment-automation`, `frontend-developer`, `production-checklist`

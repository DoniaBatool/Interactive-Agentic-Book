## Context
- Stage: plan
- Feature: 010-frontend-chat-ui
- Prompt: Create an architecture plan for integrating a frontend chat UI into the Docusaurus textbook that talks to the RAG backend `/chat` endpoint (non-stream + streaming) and displays citations.

## Response
- Wrote `specs/010-frontend-chat-ui/plan.md` covering:
  - High-level design for `RagChat` and `RagChatPanel` components.
  - Data flow for non-streaming and SSE streaming with `/chat`.
  - Integration points into MDX docs (e.g., Course Overview page) with chapter filters.
  - Error handling strategy and phased implementation (non-stream MVP → streaming → polish).

## Tests
- Not applicable (plan stage).

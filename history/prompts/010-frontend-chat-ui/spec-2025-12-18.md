## Response
- Wrote `specs/010-frontend-chat-ui/spec.md` with:
  - User stories for asking questions from a chapter, streaming experience, chapter-aware context, and error handling.
  - Functional requirements for a reusable `RagChat` component, `/chat` integration, docs integration, and UX polish.
  - Non-functional requirements and success criteria aligned with the hackathon constitution.

## Tests
- Not applicable (spec stage).

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive architecture plan for Feature 056-global-stabilization. Plan includes:
- Multi-Chapter RAG Routing Design (chapter scoring switch, affinity routing, fallback retrieval)
- Formatting Pipeline Architecture (response formatter with markdown, diagram, quiz formatting)
- AI Block Consistency Rules (formatting, token usage, retry/backoff, context limits)
- Cross-Chapter Content Validation Strategy (AI block consistency, section ordering, glossary structure)
- Build Stability Sequence (pre-build check script with MDX, metadata, AI block checks)
- File-by-File Implementation Order (7 files in sequence)
- Constraints (NO real logic, scaffolding only)

Plan establishes complete architecture for global stabilization scaffolding. All implementations are scaffolding only—no real rule enforcement, routing, or validation logic.

## OUTCOME

✅ Architecture plan complete and ready for /sp.tasks

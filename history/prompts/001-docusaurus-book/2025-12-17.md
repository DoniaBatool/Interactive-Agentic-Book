## Context
- Feature: 001-docusaurus-book
- Node 23 via nvm (WSL)

## Steps
- Shifted Docusaurus v3 TS scaffold into repo root and cleaned temp folder.
- Set site identity: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics; disabled blog; added modern hero UI and tech palette.
- Added docs: `docs/course-overview.md` (overview, outcomes, weekly breakdown, hardware) and module stubs (`intro`, `ros2`, `gazebo-unity`, `nvidia-isaac`, `vla-capstone`).
- Created manual sidebar `courseSidebar`.
- Added test script `tests/check-course-structure.mjs` and npm `test` (content check + `tsc --noEmit`); ran and confirmed green.
- Updated README for npm workflows.

## Tests
- `npm test` ✅ (content verification + typecheck)

## Next
- Treat each chapter as a feature with spec → plan → tasks → implementation.
- Full chapter content still pending (currently only overview + stubs).

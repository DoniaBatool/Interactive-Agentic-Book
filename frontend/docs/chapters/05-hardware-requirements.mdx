## Overview: Why Hardware Matters

This course sits at the intersection of three computationally intensive domains:

1. **Physics Simulation** (Isaac Sim, Gazebo)
2. **Visual Perception** (SLAM, Computer Vision)
3. **Generative AI** (LLMs, VLA Models)

Running these simultaneously requires significant hardware investment. You have two main options:

- **Option A: On-Premise Lab** (High CapEx, low OpEx)
- **Option B: Cloud-Native Lab** (Low CapEx, high OpEx)

This guide details equipment requirements, costs, and trade-offs for teaching Physical AI effectively.

## The "Digital Twin" Workstation (Required per Student)

This is the **most critical component**. NVIDIA Isaac Sim requires **RTX (Ray Tracing) GPUs**. Standard laptops (MacBooks, non-RTX Windows machines) **will not work**.

### Component Specifications

#### GPU: The Bottleneck
**Requirement**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) or higher

**Why**:
- Isaac Sim loads USD (Universal Scene Description) assets requiring high VRAM
- VLA models need GPU memory for simultaneous simulation and inference
- Real-time ray tracing for photorealistic rendering

**Ideal Options**:
| GPU | VRAM | Performance | Price (Approx.) | Notes |
|-----|------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| RTX 3090 | 24GB | Excellent | $1,200 | Best value for sim-to-real training |
| RTX 4070 Ti | 12GB | Good | $800 | Minimum for complex scenes |
| RTX 4090 | 24GB | Outstanding | $1,600 | Smoothest experience, future-proof |

#### CPU: Physics Calculations
**Requirement**: Intel Core i7 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 9

- Recorded simulation data: 10-50GB per day

**Recommendation**: Samsung 980 Pro 1TB NVMe ($100)

#### Operating System
**Requirement**: **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**

**Why**:
- ROS 2 Humble is native to Ubuntu (best performance, fewest issues)
- Isaac Sim officially supports Ubuntu (Windows support exists but is experimental)
- NVIDIA drivers and CUDA install seamlessly

**Note**: Dual-boot with Windows or use WSL2, but native Ubuntu is strongly recommended.

**Note**: Wi-Fi module is now included in the "Super" Jetson kit (no extra cost).

## The Robot Lab: Physical Hardware

For the "Physical AI" promise, you need actual robots. Three tiers based on budget:

### Option A: The "Proxy" Approach (Recommended for Budget)

Use a **quadruped (dog)** as a humanoid proxy. ROS 2, VSLAM, and Isaac Sim principles transfer 90%.

**Recommended**: **Unitree Go2 Edu** ($1,800 - $3,000)

**Pros**:
- Highly durable (can handle falls, student mistakes)
- Excellent ROS 2 support (official SDK)
- Affordable enough for multiple units
- 12 DOF (degrees of freedom) - sufficient for teaching locomotion

**Cons**:
- Not a humanoid (doesn't teach bipedal balance)

**When to Use**: Budget-constrained programs, large class sizes (1 robot per 3-4 students)

### Option B: The "Miniature Humanoid" Approach

Table-top humanoids for research and prototyping.

**Options**:
1. **Unitree G1** (~$16,000)
   - Full humanoid form factor
   - 23-43 DOF (depending on configuration)
   - ROS 2 SDK available
   - **Best choice** if budget allows

2. **Robotis OP3** (~$12,000)
   - Open-source platform
   - Proven track record in education
   - Older (2016), but stable and well-documented

3. **Budget: Hiwonder TonyPi Pro** (~$600)
   - Raspberry Pi-based (cannot run Isaac ROS efficiently)
   - Use for kinematics/walking only
   - Pair with Jetson kit for AI tasks (separate system)

### Option C: The "Premium" Lab (Sim-to-Real Focused)

For programs with significant funding or industry partnerships.

**Recommended**: **Unitree G1 Humanoid** ($16,000)

**Why**:
- One of few commercially available humanoids with **dynamic walking**
- SDK open enough for students to inject ROS 2 controllers
- Used in research (papers, benchmarks for reproducibility)

**Alternative**: **Boston Dynamics Spot** ($75,000) - Not humanoid but gold-standard for robustness.

## Lab Architecture Summary

For a teaching lab supporting 20 students:

| Component | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Sim Workstations** | 20 | $2,500 | $50,000 | Students can pair for lower cost |
| **Edge AI Kits** | 10 | $750 | $7,500 | Shared among pairs |
| **Robots** | 5 | $3,000 | $15,000 | Unitree Go2, 1 per 4 students |
| **Infrastructure** | 1 | $5,000 | $5,000 | Networking, storage server |
| **Total** | | | **$77,500** | |

**Cost-Saving Options**:
- Students use personal laptops (if they meet GPU requirements)
- Cloud workstations (see Option 2 below)
- Fewer robots (heavy rotation schedule)

**Result**: ~$3,875 per student for a full semester course.

## Option 2: Cloud-Native Lab (High OpEx)

If upfront capital is limited, rent cloud resources.

### Cloud Workstations (AWS/Azure)

**Instance Type**: AWS **g5.2xlarge** (A10G GPU, 24GB VRAM)

**Specifications**:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA A10G (similar to RTX 3080)
- **CPU**: 8 vCPUs
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Cost**: ~$1.50/hour (spot/on-demand mix)

**Usage Calculation** (per student):
- 10 hours/week × 12 weeks = 120 hours
- 120 hours × $1.50 = **$180/student for semester**
- EBS storage (500GB): ~$50/semester

**Total Cloud Cost**: **$230/student/semester**

**Advantages**:
- No upfront hardware cost
- Scalable (spin up 100 instances for final project week)
- Always latest GPU models

**Disadvantages**:
- Recurring cost every semester
- Latency for interactive work
- Internet dependency

### Hybrid Approach

- **Simulation**: Cloud (AWS g5 instances)
- **Deployment**: Local Jetson kits + robots

**Rationale**: Simulation runs well remotely, but **controlling physical robots from cloud has dangerous latency** (50-200ms). Local edge devices are essential for real-time control.

### Cost Comparison: On-Premise vs. Cloud (5-Year Horizon)

| Scenario | Year 1 | Years 2-5 | 5-Year Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **On-Premise** (20 workstations) | $77,500 | $5,000/year (maintenance) | $97,500 |
| **Cloud** (20 students × 2 semesters/year) | $9,200 + $15,000 (robots/kits) | $9,200/year | $61,000 |

**Verdict**: Cloud is cheaper **if you have less than 3 semesters of use**. For established programs, on-premise wins.

## Software Costs (Free vs. Paid)

Good news: Most software is **open-source and free**.

| Software | License | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Ubuntu 22.04** | Free | $0 |
| **ROS 2 Humble** | Apache 2.0 | $0 |
| **Gazebo** | Apache 2.0 | $0 |
| **Isaac Sim** | Free (NVIDIA Omniverse) | $0 |
| **Isaac ROS** | Apache 2.0 | $0 |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | MIT | $0 (local inference) |
| **GPT-4 API** | Pay-per-use | ~$0.03/1K tokens |

**API Costs** (GPT-4 for VLA):
- Average query: 1,000 tokens = $0.03
- 100 queries/student/semester = **$3/student**

**Total Software Cost**: ~$3/student/semester (negligible)

## Maintenance and Support

### On-Premise Lab
- **IT Support**: 0.25 FTE (~$20k/year for lab tech)
- **Repairs**: ~5% of hardware cost annually (~$4k/year)

### Cloud Lab
- **IT Support**: Minimal (cloud provider handles infrastructure)
- **Recurring Subscriptions**: AWS/Azure costs

## Minimal Viable Setup (Budget-Constrained)

**For Programs with Under $10k Budget**:

1. **No Workstations**: Students use AWS cloud instances ($230/student)
2. **1 Jetson Kit**: Shared among all students ($750)
3. **1 Quadruped Robot**: Unitree Go2 Standard ($1,800)
4. **Software**: All free/open-source

**Total**: ~$2,550 + cloud costs

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Students develop in simulation (cloud)
- Rotate access to physical hardware for final projects
- Emphasize sim-to-real transfer (most development happens virtually)

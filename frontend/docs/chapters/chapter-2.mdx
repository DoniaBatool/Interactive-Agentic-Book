## Forces & Motion

Have you ever pushed a shopping cart or pulled a wagon? When you do, you're applying a force. A force is simply a push or pull that can make something move, stop moving, or change direction. Forces are everywhere in our daily lives, and understanding them is the first step to understanding how robots work.

Motion happens when an object changes its position over time. Think about a ball rolling down a hill. The ball is moving because forces are acting on it. Gravity pulls the ball downward, and the ground pushes back up. These forces work together to create the motion you see. Every robot needs to understand forces and motion to move around and interact with the world.

Sir Isaac Newton discovered three important laws about forces and motion that help us understand how everything moves. Newton's First Law says that objects at rest stay at rest, and objects in motion stay in motion, unless a force acts on them. This means a robot sitting still will stay still until something makes it move. Newton's Second Law explains that the more force you apply, the faster an object accelerates. A stronger motor in a robot means it can move faster or lift heavier objects. Newton's Third Law tells us that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. When a robot's wheel pushes against the ground, the ground pushes back, allowing the robot to move forward.

Here are some everyday examples of forces and motion you might recognize. When you ride a bicycle, your feet push on the pedals, creating a force that turns the wheels. The wheels push against the ground, and the ground pushes back, propelling you forward. When you throw a ball, your hand applies a force that makes the ball move through the air. Even something as simple as opening a door requires force. You push or pull on the door handle, applying force that overcomes friction and makes the door move.

## Energy & Work

Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. Think of energy as the fuel that makes everything happen. When you have energy, you can move things, heat things up, or make things happen. Work, in physics terms, happens when a force moves an object over a distance. If you push a heavy box across the floor, you're doing work. The amount of work depends on how hard you push and how far the box moves.

There are different types of energy that robots use. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. A moving robot has kinetic energy because it's moving. Potential energy is stored energy, like a spring that's been compressed or a battery that's been charged. When a robot lifts its arm, it stores potential energy. When the arm comes down, that potential energy converts to kinetic energy, making the arm move. Mechanical efficiency tells us how well a system converts input energy into useful work. A perfectly efficient system would use all its energy for useful work, but in reality, some energy is always lost as heat or friction.

Real-world examples help us understand these concepts better. A wind-up toy stores potential energy when you wind it up. As it unwinds, that potential energy becomes kinetic energy, making the toy move. A car engine converts chemical energy from gasoline into kinetic energy that moves the car. Even your body converts chemical energy from food into the energy you use to walk, run, or play. In robots, batteries store chemical energy that converts to electrical energy, which then powers motors that create motion.

## Simple Machines

Simple machines are basic tools that make work easier by changing the direction or size of a force. There are six types of simple machines that people have used for thousands of years. Each one helps us do work with less effort. Understanding simple machines helps us understand how complex robots work, because robots use combinations of these simple machines to perform tasks.

The six types of simple machines are the lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, screw, and wedge. A lever is a rigid bar that pivots on a point called a fulcrum. When you use a seesaw, you're using a lever. The fulcrum is in the middle, and you can lift a heavier person by sitting farther from the center. A pulley is a wheel with a rope or chain wrapped around it. Pulleys help lift heavy objects by changing the direction of force. You pull down, and the object goes up. A wheel and axle is a wheel attached to a rod. When you turn the wheel, the axle turns too, making it easier to move heavy loads. Cars use wheels and axles to move smoothly.

An inclined plane is a slanted surface that makes it easier to move objects up or down. A ramp is an inclined plane. It's much easier to push a heavy box up a ramp than to lift it straight up. A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. When you turn a screw, the threads act like a tiny inclined plane, making it easier to push the screw into wood. A wedge is two inclined planes back-to-back. An axe blade is a wedge that splits wood by concentrating force into a small area.

Mechanical advantage is why these simple machines matter so much. Mechanical advantage tells us how much a machine multiplies the force you put into it. A machine with a mechanical advantage of 2 means you only need to push with half the force to move something twice as heavy. Robots use simple machines to make their movements more powerful and efficient. A robot arm might use levers and pulleys to lift heavy objects with small motors. The mechanical advantage allows the robot to do work that would otherwise require much more power.

## Mechanical Systems in Robotics

Robots use mechanical systems to move, lift, and interact with the world around them. These systems combine simple machines with motors and sensors to create complex movements. Understanding how robots use mechanical systems helps us understand how they can perform tasks that would be difficult or dangerous for humans.

Actuators are the parts of robots that create movement. Motors are the most common type of actuator. Electric motors convert electrical energy into rotational motion, spinning wheels or turning joints. Servo motors are special motors that can move to specific positions with great precision. Pneumatic actuators use compressed air to create linear motion, like extending and retracting a robot arm. Hydraulic actuators work similarly but use pressurized fluid instead of air. Each type of actuator has advantages for different tasks.

Force transmission is how robots move forces from one part to another. Gears are toothed wheels that mesh together to transfer motion and multiply force. A small gear turning a large gear can create more force but less speed. Belts and chains connect rotating parts over distances. A bicycle chain transfers force from the pedals to the wheels. Linkages are rigid connections that transfer motion in specific ways. A robot arm uses linkages to move the hand in precise patterns based on how the joints move.

Safety considerations are crucial when working with mechanical systems. Robots can apply large forces that could injure people or damage equipment. Safety systems include emergency stop buttons, force sensors that detect when a robot hits something, and speed limits that prevent dangerous movements. Proper maintenance keeps mechanical systems working safely. Lubrication reduces friction and wear. Regular inspections catch problems before they cause failures. Understanding these safety principles helps us design and use robots responsibly.

## Glossary

**Force**: A push or pull that can cause an object to move, stop, or change direction. Forces are measured in Newtons and can be applied in different ways, like when you push a door open or pull a wagon. Every force has both strength (how hard you push or pull) and direction (which way you push or pull).

**Motion**: The change in position of an object over time. Motion happens when forces act on objects. A ball rolling, a car driving, and a robot moving its arm are all examples of motion. Motion can be described by speed (how fast) and direction (which way).

**Work**: In physics, work happens when a force moves an object over a distance. If you push a box across the floor, you're doing work. The amount of work depends on how hard you push and how far the box moves. Work is measured in Joules, and more work means more energy was used.

**Energy**: The ability to do work or cause change. Energy comes in different forms like kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy). A moving robot has kinetic energy, while a charged battery has potential energy. Energy can be converted from one form to another, like when a battery powers a motor.

**Mechanical Advantage**: How much a machine multiplies the force you put into it. A machine with a mechanical advantage of 2 means you only need half the force to move something twice as heavy. Simple machines provide mechanical advantage, making it easier to do work. Robots use mechanical advantage to lift heavy objects with small motors.

**Simple Machine**: A basic tool that makes work easier by changing the direction or size of a force. There are six types: lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, screw, and wedge. Each simple machine helps us do work with less effort. Complex machines, including robots, combine multiple simple machines to perform tasks.

**Efficiency**: How well a system converts input energy into useful work. A perfectly efficient system would use all its energy for useful work, but in reality, some energy is always lost as heat or friction. Higher efficiency means less wasted energy. Robots are designed to be as efficient as possible to save battery power and reduce heat.

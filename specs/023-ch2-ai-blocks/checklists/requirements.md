**Feature**: 023-ch2-ai-blocks
**Purpose**: Validate spec completeness
**Created**: 2025-01-27

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details included
- [x] Focused on user value
- [x] Clear, complete mandatory sections

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- [x] Testable requirements
- [x] Measurable success criteria
- [x] Defined acceptance criteria
- [x] Dependencies identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All user flows covered
- [x] No implementation leakage
- [x] Ready for /sp.plan

## Validation Results

### User Stories
- [x] User Story 1 (P1): Learner Sees AI Blocks Rendered in Chapter 2 - Complete with acceptance scenarios
- [x] User Story 2 (P1): Developer Verifies MDX Component Integration - Complete with acceptance scenarios
- [x] Edge cases documented

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Chapter 2 MDX File (FR-001 to FR-005) - Complete
- [x] Component Mapping (FR-006 to FR-008) - Complete
- [x] MDX Rendering Layer (FR-009 to FR-011) - Complete
- [x] Build Validation (FR-012 to FR-015) - Complete
- [x] Documentation Contract (FR-016) - Complete

### Success Criteria
- [x] SC-001 to SC-007 - All defined and measurable

### Constraints
- [x] All constraints documented (reuse components, no new logic, no breaking changes)

### Dependencies
- [x] All dependencies identified (Feature 004, Feature 010/014, Docusaurus MDX Configuration)

### Out of Scope
- [x] Clear boundaries defined (no real AI logic, no new components, no backend integration)

## Specification Quality Assessment

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASS**

All mandatory sections complete, requirements testable, success criteria measurable, dependencies identified, constraints documented, out of scope clear.

**Ready for**: `/sp.plan` - Architecture planning phase (if needed) or `/sp.tasks` - Implementation tasks phase

# Research Notes: Chapter 5 – Vision-Language-Action Capstone

Reference: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics brief.
- Voice-to-action: ASR (e.g., Whisper) → intent parsing → plan.
- Planning/execution: Nav2 for navigation; ROS actions for arm/hand manipulation.
- Perception hooks: vision + language for object grounding.
- Safety: guardrails, rate limits, confirmation steps.
- Metrics: task success, latency, safety events.

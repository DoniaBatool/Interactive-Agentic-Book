# Research Notes: Chapter 3 – Gazebo & Unity Digital Twin

Reference: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics brief.
- Gazebo: physics, gravity, collisions; URDF/SDF integration; sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth, IMU).
- Unity: high-fidelity visualization and HRI demos; complements Gazebo physics.
- Bridge: ROS interfaces/topics/actions; sim vs. real naming and parameters.
- Safety: simulation-first, rate limits, collision models.

**Purpose**: Validate spec completeness
**Created**: 2025-01-27

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details included
- [x] Focused on user value
- [x] Clear, complete mandatory sections

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- [x] Testable requirements
- [x] Measurable success criteria
- [x] Defined acceptance criteria
- [x] Dependencies identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All user flows covered
- [x] No implementation leakage
- [x] Ready for /sp.plan

## Validation Results

### User Stories
- [x] User Story 1 (P1): Developer Wires Chapter 2 into Backend Runtime - Complete with acceptance scenarios
- [x] User Story 2 (P1): System Routes Chapter 2 AI Block Requests - Complete with acceptance scenarios
- [x] Edge cases documented

### Functional Requirements
- [x] API Layer Updates (FR-001) - Complete
- [x] Runtime Engine Awareness (FR-002) - Complete
- [x] RAG Layer for Chapter 2 (FR-003) - Complete
- [x] Subagent Draft Files (FR-004) - Complete

### Dependencies
- [x] All dependencies identified (Feature 006, Feature 023, Chapter 1 chunks, existing subagents, skills layer)

### Out of Scope
- [x] Clear boundaries defined (no real AI logic, no RAG implementation, no subagent logic)

## Specification Quality Assessment

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASS**

All mandatory sections complete, requirements testable, success criteria measurable, dependencies identified, constraints documented, out of scope clear.

**Ready for**: `/sp.plan` - Architecture planning phase

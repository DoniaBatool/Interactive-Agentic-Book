# Research Notes: Intro to Physical AI

Sources: Hackathon brief (Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics).
- Physical AI focus: embodied intelligence, physics awareness.
- Sensors: LiDAR, depth/RGB cameras, IMUs, force/torque.
- Why it matters: humanoids align with human environments; data-rich interactions.
- Safety/Ethics: human-robot interaction, risk awareness.
- Roadmap: modules (Intro, ROS2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA/Capstone).

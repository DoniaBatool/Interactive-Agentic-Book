# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 2 — RAG Chunking, Embeddings & Qdrant Collection Setup

**Feature**: 012-chapter-2-rag
**Purpose**: Validate spec completeness
**Created**: 2025-12-05

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details included
- [x] Focused on user value
- [x] Clear, complete mandatory sections

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- [x] Testable requirements
- [x] Measurable success criteria
- [x] Defined acceptance criteria
- [x] Dependencies identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All user flows covered
- [x] No implementation leakage
- [x] Ready for /sp.plan

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Check
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on scaffolding and TODO placeholders, not real implementation
- ✅ **Focused on user value**: Spec clearly explains RAG foundations for Chapter 2 AI blocks
- ✅ **Clear mandatory sections**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Assumptions, Success Criteria) are present

### Requirement Completeness Check
- ✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]**: All requirements are clear and specific
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: All functional requirements can be tested by checking file existence, imports, and placeholder functions
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: Success criteria are specific and measurable (files exist, imports work, backend starts)
- ✅ **Defined acceptance criteria**: Acceptance criteria clearly defined in spec
- ✅ **Dependencies identified**: Assumptions section clearly identifies dependencies (existing files from Features 005, 011)

### Feature Readiness Check
- ✅ **All user flows covered**: User stories cover developer setup, system admin configuration, and future developer implementation
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec only defines scaffolding and placeholders, no real logic
- ✅ **Ready for /sp.plan**: Spec is complete and ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Spec follows pattern from Feature 005 (AI Runtime Engine) and Feature 011 (Chapter 2 AI Blocks)
- All requirements are scaffolding-focused (no real implementation)
- Clear separation between scaffolding (this feature) and implementation (future features)
- Contracts and schemas defined for future reference

## Status

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for /sp.plan**

Implement Feature 0 — Base Project Initialization for the AI-Agentic Interactive Book Platform.

Use the tasks generated in /sp.tasks and create all folders, files, placeholders, scaffolds, and environment templates exactly as specified.

The implementation must include:

- Initialize a fresh Docusaurus project using the latest stable version
- Generate global layout components (navbar, footer) as placeholder React components
- Create BetterAuth folder structure with config placeholders (no logic)
- Create AgentKit folder structure with empty config files (no logic)
- Create Claude Subagents and Skills folder structure with placeholder files
- Initialize backend FastAPI scaffold with empty routers
- Create Qdrant client wrapper placeholder
- Create placeholder LLM provider wrappers (OpenAI, Claude)
- Create empty routing structure for backend
- Create `.env.example` with required variables
- Create and organize these folders:
  /frontend
  /backend
  /agents
  /skills
  /chapters
  /content
  /public
  /scripts

Do NOT implement business logic.
Only generate the scaffolding and empty structured architecture exactly according to Feature 0 plan and tasks.
